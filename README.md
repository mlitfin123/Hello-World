# War Game
This is game using the turtle feature in Python.
The object of the game is to dodge the enemy bullets while advancing levels by shooting all of the enemies.
Each level more enemies appear.
The game ends when the user runs out of lives.

This is a first coding project meant for practice and critique is welcome.
